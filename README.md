To create a calculator with colorful buttons, we will use Python's Tkinter library for GUI development. The architecture of the application will be divided into three main parts:

1. `main.py`: This is the entry point of the application. It will create an instance of the `Calculator` class and start the Tkinter event loop.

2. `calculator.py`: This file will contain the `Calculator` class. This class will handle the creation of the calculator's GUI and the logic for performing calculations.

3. `button.py`: This file will contain the `Button` class. This class will handle the creation of colorful buttons.

Let's start with the `main.py` file:
